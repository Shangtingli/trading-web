1. The WatchList Could only be Removed when you add at least one item to the watch list
	(OnChange might fix the problem)
	(Solved: Using JQuery Instead)

2. The ajax webpage calls itself
	(Solved: make sure you add e.preventDefault() at every listener event)

3. Suggestions: When you refresh watch list just refresh the price and trend icon

4. Use Continuation Graph for the main chart. I mean, the chart that accepts data and then render new data points on the canvas. Might need to create new database related to user metadata and time.

5. Also need to find out how to create the database for tickers such that all tickers are in the AlphaVantage API.

6. Also Tell the user if a ticker does not exist
